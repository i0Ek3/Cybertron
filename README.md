# Cybertron

> Inspiried by **Transformers**, welcome to Cybertron.

Cybertron is an interim uprising for me, cause of I saw the animated film `Transformers: War for Cybertron` someday. So, I would say that why not? That's really funny, it's worth it. 

This project will be iterate the multiple versions, also I need to watch other parts of Transformer to perfect the detail, that's need time, and there's limitation on my time. So, take a while for wait, I wouldn't let you guys down. 

Let's GO!

## v1

First version of Cybertron could only show the basic message of Transformers, who's the boss of the Autobots and Decepticons.

## v2

Complete the names of Autobots and Decepticons, and what they can transformed.

## v3

The war.
